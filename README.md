Hello!

This repo contains the front-end challenge for Shopify's 2018 Winternship.

The challenge, outlined in the challenges page, replicates the image
of a e-mail registration box and validates the email. If the input does't
contain a valid e-mail a notice is given to the user otherwise a success
notice is given.

//Notes
- The e-mail regex string is from http://emailregex.com/ and was tested 
and codified by http://www.regex101.com

- The form doesn't functionally work as a submission form, it's just a 'div'
which mimics the funcitonality. Changing 'div' to 'form' and adding the
appropriate calls could make it useful. Alternatively, one could use it 
as is but include an ajax call within the validation to add the 
functionality :)


Best,

Nguyen
